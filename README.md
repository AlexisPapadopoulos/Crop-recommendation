Crop Recommendation Using Classification and Regression Models
Introduction
This project presents an analysis of the Crop Recommendation Dataset, focusing on the development and evaluation of multiple classification models and one regression model. The primary objectives are:
To predict the most suitable crop based on agro-climatic conditions
To evaluate model performance and detect overfitting or underfitting
To analyze how different hyperparameters affect model behavior
The model uses soil and environmental parameters to recommend crops, offering potential real-world applications in precision agriculture and decision support systems.
Dataset Overview
The dataset was retrieved from Kaggle:

N – Nitrogen content in the soil (mg/kg)
P – Phosphorus content in the soil (mg/kg)
K – Potassium content in the soil (mg/kg)
Temperature – Average temperature (°C)
Humidity – Average relative humidity (%)
pH – Soil pH value
Rainfall – Rainfall (mm)
Target Variable
Label – Crop type (22 distinct crop classes)
Data Quality Assessment
Data Preparation Steps
Dataset Loading
Imported the dataset from Kaggle in CSV format.
Data Validation
Renamed columns to improve clarity and consistency.
Verified data integrity and corrected header inconsistencies.
Checked for missing or null values.
Preprocessing
Ensured all feature columns were numeric.
Prepared the dataset for correlation analysis and modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Correlation Analysis
A correlation matrix was used to identify relationships between agro-climatic features.
Nutrient values (N, P, K) showed meaningful correlations with certain crops.
Environmental factors such as temperature, rainfall, and humidity played a significant role in crop suitability.
Visualizations
Boxplots and distribution plots were used to analyze feature ranges.
Heatmaps highlighted the most influential variables affecting crop classification.
Feature comparisons helped identify patterns associated with specific crops.
Modeling Approach
Models Used
Multiple classification models were trained to predict crop labels.
A regression model was implemented to explore continuous prediction behavior.
Model performance was evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy and error measures.
Model Evaluation
Training and validation results were compared to assess:
Overfitting vs. underfitting
Sensitivity to hyperparameter changes
Feature importance analysis provided insights into key decision drivers.
Key Insights
Soil nutrients and rainfall are among the most influential features.
Certain crops are highly sensitive to temperature and humidity variations.
Model performance improves significantly with proper feature scaling and tuning.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning models can effectively recommend crops based on agro-climatic data. The analysis highlights the importance of soil nutrients and environmental conditions in agricultural decision-making.
Future work may include:
Expanding the dataset with regional data
Incorporating real-time weather inputs
Deploying the model as a web or mobile application
